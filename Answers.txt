1. What has been your experience learning bash?
My experience learning bash has been really interesting. I was starting from the ground up and really struggling with it. 
I had to turn in a lot of assignments late because I had to continually update my script to get it to function the way I wanted
it to work. Overall though, it has been incredibly helpful and I think I will use this in the future!


2. What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?
I think it would have been easier if there was less dependence on the video lectures and more in class lectures that explained
the code. Although, the videos are very clear and helpful in helping me understand bash.


3. Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?
I am not sure how long each one took but I spent at least 3-4 hours over many days per each assignment in order to fully
understand and learn bash.


4. Are you able to see how the programs used in this class or learning bash would be helpful for your career?
Yes! Bash could definitely be useful in my career because I will definitely have to script eventually and this course is
great for giving the fundamentals. Plus I enjoy using Linux and getting to poke around in Ubuntu, that is probably my favorite 
part of this class. I thought it was cool that in Ubuntu you can connect your last.fm account to TuneBox!
